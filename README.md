This is my personal website. It runs a ExpressJs server and serves html webpages using Handlebars as a template engine.

This webiste is currently running (hopefully) on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu 20 instance and can be visited at my website connor-brown.dev

If you would like to run this website yourself for whatever reason it should be run in the form ```node index.js <path to SSL certificate> <path to SSL private key> <path to .env with database info>```
